I'm Tomer, and I'm diving into the world of programming to build a strong foundation in
 DevOps, Git, Python, and Linux. I’m drawn to the power of automation,
 the elegance of clean code, and the challenge of solving 
real-world problems through technology
. My goal is to become proficient in managing infrastructure,
 streamlining development workflows, 
and creating tools that make systems more efficient and reliable.
 I see programming not just as a skill,
 but as a gateway to innovation and impact.
🔧 Linux: The backbone of most servers and cloud environments. Start with basic commands, file systems, and shell scripting. It’s essential for understanding how systems behave.

📁 Git: Your version control sidekick. Learn how to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage code across environments. GitHub is your playground.

🐍 Python: The automation engine. Use it to write scripts, manage deployments, and build tools. It’s especially useful for CI/CD pipelines and cloud automation.

⚙️ DevOps Tools: Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Terraform. These tools help you build, test, and deploy software efficiently.
